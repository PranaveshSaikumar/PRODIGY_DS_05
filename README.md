# Prodigy InfoTech Internship: Data Analysis
This is my repository for Prodigy Infotech Internship! These documents are for the task 5 of my internship program on data analysis and categorical representation.

# Task Obejctive:
Analyze traffic accident data to identify patterns related to road conditions, weather, and time of day. Visualize accident hotspots and contributing factors.

# Insights:
From traffic accident data analysis, patterns show higher accident rates during adverse weather conditions (e.g., rain, snow) and at intersections with poor visibility or insufficient road markings. Accidents peak during rush hours, indicating congestion and poor road conditions as contributing factors.
